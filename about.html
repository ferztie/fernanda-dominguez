                    Hello!
                    My name is Fernanda DomÃ­nguez, a 30 years old Mexican interested in UX/UI design trends and everything code related.
                    IÂ´m an independent happy being, IÂ´m adaptable, flexible, proactive and a people person, who loves teamwork, collaboration, and developing relationships.
                    Also, I consider myself tech-savvy, loving to learn and expand my creativity canvas always looking for new solutions. IÂ´m mostly a self-taught person in the IT world but I have studied dramatic arts, where I was totally deconstructed which gives me empathy to understand anyone, and a bachelor's degree in fashion design where I studied sociology, how trends are born, and cultural analysis.
                    My work encompasses graphics and identity, websites and digital experiences, product development, strategy, and positioning.
                    I enjoy developing interactive solutions and experiences for prototypes, web, and apps.
                    Iâ€™ve been developing products (UI/UX) for 5 years and working in IT teams for 3 years.
                    My technology skills include Adobe XD, Illustrator, and Photoshop, Figma. For coding structure, I use HTML and CSS, Angular IONIC 6, and Bootstrap, I use Visual Studio Code and also Visual Studio. For Agile and teamwork, Iâ€™m comfortable working on Kanban boards, Jira, Sourcetree, Github, Slack, InVision, and Teams. I also have developed and managed WP.
                    In my most recent work experiences for TotalPlay, I worked as a UXD, designing flows according to our client's needs for a Power BI alike product, called FFM Cloud for TotalPlay Empresarial, and before that my role also involved UXE duties, translating XD prototypes to Angular and Bootstrap, for a fintech company called Finamex.
                    My designing/artistic background has given me empathic and analytic skills. Prioritizing a company's brand identity and design systems, always with the user at the center.
                    I believe in pixel perfect and find a way to apply it to web development by designing prototypes and flows, being aware of the frameworks, and FrontEnd's ability to interpret them.

                        <p> 
                            Hey there, my name is Fernanda, you could say I wasnâ€™t born to fit in a box, I wanted to study piano for a living. 
                            I got in a theater bachelorâ€™s degree, until I got depressed but got really good, 
                            discover a call in singing but also scenography and makeup.
                            It was a mess. My urge to create couldnâ€™t really fit in a scenery. (Well not in Mexico).
                            </br>   
                                So,  Where could I find a canvas for creativity and urge. Yesâ€¦ Fashion.
                            </br> 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I changed to a Fashion Design Bachelorâ€™s degree, in the Laureates University, UVM en Mexicoâ€™s city.
                            Sociology, tendencies, collections, runways, fashion events, had so much fun. Made my greatest friends.
                            </br> 
                            I, then started an editorial inclined platform to organize Mexicoâ€™s mess to get supplies.
                            Boomer, that makes creation a lot slower :( 
                                Taking fashion photos, and looking for suppliers., was born Vuzzola, compass in Italian.  I develop PR skills and got in great shows, and started collaborating with bigger firms. 
                                More that a magazine, I wanted to deliver a more tech way to share this.
                            </br> 
                            Decided to make the web-app, I meet with a developer, presented the idea, he agreed to partner with the project but asked me for the interphase designâ€¦ and I was there, designing an UI interphase for the first time in my life. 
                            </br> 
                        </p> 
                        <p>
                            It was fun, creative and useful. The developer disappeared  and I got distracted launching my fashion brand called DomÃ­nguez MÃ©xico, a leatherâ€™s good original design brand (not re-sellers  charade).
                            Found investment with a former professor from the University, develop the product and started selling. 
                            Urged to make my webpage I become keen in finding the most suitable way to develop my webpage, went through WIX, WordPress, and HTML CSS. 
                            Youtube on one hand and on the other on my non-musical keyboard.
                            </br> 
                            I found my calling, developing web solutions, from the design of the interphase to some whole developments. 
                            </br> 
                            I enjoy the collaboration with other developers and designers, but also going solo itâ€™s so fun. 
                            </br> 
                            Iâ€™m always learning new ways to solve things, and the story ends handsomely, I finally found the most unlimited form of creation.
