            Hey there, my name is Fernanda, you could say I wasn’t born to fit in a box, I wanted to study piano for a living. 
        I got in a theater bachelor’s degree, until I got depressed but got really good, 
        discover a call in singing but also scenography and makeup.
        It was a mess. My urge to create couldn’t really fit in a scenery. (Well not in Mexico).
        </br>   
        So,  Where could I find a canvas for creativity and urge. Yes… Fashion.
        </br> 
        </p>
        <p>
            I changed to a Fashion Design Bachelor’s degree, in the Laureates University, UVM en Mexico’s city.
            Sociology, tendencies, collections, runways, fashion events, had so much fun. Made my greatest friends.
            </br> 
            I, then started an editorial inclined platform to organize Mexico’s mess to get supplies.
            Boomer, that makes creation a lot slower :( 
            Taking fashion photos, and looking for suppliers., was born Vuzzola, compass in Italian.  I develop PR skills and got in great shows, and started collaborating with bigger firms. 
            More that a magazine, I wanted to deliver a more tech way to share this.
            </br> 
            Decided to make the web-app, I meet with a developer, presented the idea, he agreed to partner with the project but asked me for the interphase design… and I was there, designing an UI interphase for the first time in my life. 
            </br> 
        </p>
        <p>
            It was fun, creative and useful. The developer disappeared  and I got distracted launching my fashion brand called Domínguez México, a leather’s good original design brand (not re-sellers  charade).
            Found investment with a former professor from the University, develop the product and started selling. 
            Urged to make my webpage I become keen in finding the most suitable way to develop my webpage, went through WIX, WordPress, and HTML CSS. 
            Youtube on one hand and on the other on my non-musical keyboard.
             </br> 
            I found my calling, developing web solutions, from the design of the interphase to some whole developments. 
            </br> 
            I enjoy the collaboration with other developers and designers, but also going solo it’s so fun. 
            </br> 
            I’m always learning new ways to solve things, and the story ends handsomely, I finally found the most unlimited form of creation.
