                        <p> 
                            Hey there, my name is Fernanda, you could say I wasnâ€™t born to fit in a box, I wanted to study piano for a living. 
                            I got in a theater bachelorâ€™s degree, until I got depressed but got really good, 
                            discover a call in singing but also scenography and makeup.
                            It was a mess. My urge to create couldnâ€™t really fit in a scenery. (Well not in Mexico).
                            </br>   
                                So,  Where could I find a canvas for creativity and urge. Yesâ€¦ Fashion.
                            </br> 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I changed to a Fashion Design Bachelorâ€™s degree, in the Laureates University, UVM en Mexicoâ€™s city.
                            Sociology, tendencies, collections, runways, fashion events, had so much fun. Made my greatest friends.
                            </br> 
                            I, then started an editorial inclined platform to organize Mexicoâ€™s mess to get supplies.
                            Boomer, that makes creation a lot slower :( 
                                Taking fashion photos, and looking for suppliers., was born Vuzzola, compass in Italian.  I develop PR skills and got in great shows, and started collaborating with bigger firms. 
                                More that a magazine, I wanted to deliver a more tech way to share this.
                            </br> 
                            Decided to make the web-app, I meet with a developer, presented the idea, he agreed to partner with the project but asked me for the interphase designâ€¦ and I was there, designing an UI interphase for the first time in my life. 
                            </br> 
                        </p> -->
                        <p>
                            It was fun, creative and useful. The developer disappeared  and I got distracted launching my fashion brand called DomÃ­nguez MÃ©xico, a leatherâ€™s good original design brand (not re-sellers  charade).
                            Found investment with a former professor from the University, develop the product and started selling. 
                            Urged to make my webpage I become keen in finding the most suitable way to develop my webpage, went through WIX, WordPress, and HTML CSS. 
                            Youtube on one hand and on the other on my non-musical keyboard.
                            </br> 
                            I found my calling, developing web solutions, from the design of the interphase to some whole developments. 
                            </br> 
                            I enjoy the collaboration with other developers and designers, but also going solo itâ€™s so fun. 
                            </br> 
                            Iâ€™m always learning new ways to solve things, and the story ends handsomely, I finally found the most unlimited form of creation.
